# DIY MIDI Controller By Will May (2022)

Generalized source code used to upload to any arduino board with USB capabilities. Dependent on the Arduio IDE MIDIUSB library.
This was used for a arduino leonardo but can be used for a micro and other boards as well.

# Final Product using a 3D Printed shell, arcade buttons, 2 rotary knobs, and custom jumper wires

# Basic prototype using only 4 buttons and 2 potentiometer knobs
This was a basic prototype using the same code adjusted for 4 buttons and 1 potentiometer knob. The circuit diagram shows the basic layout
which can be adjusted for any number of I/O pins
